## Short Desciption 

### What is the problem

In reponse of the government to the pandemic, a community quarrantine is issued. The first one to be affected in access will be the necessary services as they focus on implementing the community quarrantine with few counter measures. As such, people that are in need of these services are qeueing in an overwhelming matter, making the quarrantine harder and harder to bear. If such services were provided, we could migitate the number of uncooperative people to further implement the quarrantine whilst preventing the extension of the quarrantine.

### How can Technology help?

Local communities can further collaborate in community services and activities through providing the basic services needed to ease up the burden of taking long lines just to buy those necessities whilst giving the community a chance of collaboration to productively finish a volunteer task in a matter of time.

### The Idea
Providing the basic services and the call of opportunity can give people a social interaction they need as well as help in the times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
