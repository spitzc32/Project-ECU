# Project ECU: A platform for that brings the Community together
The current way we receive information is either a facebook page of a local mayor or some platform of the government which is aimed to inform the whole country. But the problem here is that it is way too abstract as it only caters its audiences to know what happens at that level. The information being released are sometimes late due to reaffirming to other more local level if the information received is right. For that we aimed to give services through information at the smallest localized level we intended to get.

This is why Project ECU was built for the knowledge and information it would bring at a local level. It was aimed to be used as a social media platform for the community that provides 4 main services, namely: Health, Information, Volunteer and Food Services, which are mainly compromised during this pandemic. Information can move a community to take action knowing what is currently happening around them, can mobilize groups if they are updated to a certain situation, and conveniently move if they knew where to buy goods they need.

## The Pandemic
The Pandemic has forced us to do things differently, especially our movements. We decided to do it virtually, but the information we had online was either an information obtained at a national level which is not necessarily essential for us since what we need is to know is what is happening nearby us, something that needs a local level of information especially when it comes to the essential services that are limited during this pandemic.   

### Limited Food Service
This pandemic made us realize that we should pursue local goods as exported goods lessened since we all need to feed our own people before others. It also made us realize that as our loads in online stores increases the time consumed for it to be delivered also increases. This gave us a realization that local goods were the answer to lessen the load as well as give our locals an alternative job this pandemic.

### Mental Health Problems 
This pandemic took away our normal lives. Therefore we can expect some issues that we feel more alone than ever, no matter the age. We were thinking that this pandemic was like a summer vacation, but what we don't know is that the isolation is slowly eating us away. This gave a clue on one of the good things to leverage with current technology available for us today. But this does not necessarily mean that we do not need human contact. We need it, so we should also promote it.

### Active Volunteers
This pandemic called for volunteers especially for those who are vulnerable to the disease. With the community's local cooperation, we could actually give what we have to someone in need, or we could ask for what we need and participate nearby to where we are needed. Cooperation is essential to this pandemic, with our manpower and technology, we might actually make this pandemic better with care.  

## Conclusion
Essential services can be provided through information. What makes us move together is the information we receive. With a little care, we can actually leverage this product down to our community.
